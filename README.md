# RIG-Using-DataGemma
DataGemma is an open model developed by Google to connect LLMs with trust-worthy, factual, real-world data sourced from Googleâ€™s DataCommons. 
In DataGemma, Retrieval-Interleaved Generation (RIG) enhances the accuracy and relevance of outputs. 
To implement RIG: 
Pre-requisites:

A100 GPU
High-RAM runtime 
Hugging Face Token
